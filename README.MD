## Who are we

We are expert mobile developers, based in Paris, working with hybrid and cross plateform technologies. 

Our goal is to help the client business succeed, by solving togethers theirs problems using agile and lean, 
and developping the best product to satisfy the client's user needs.

Learn more about us [in our french website](http://www.bam.tech/).

## Why this repository

Part of lean philosophy is to standardize best practices and spread them out.

Every time a developer is struggling doing a part of his job (eg, change the application icon, deploying features very fast using code push, ect...), 
we help him solve his problem and then together write either a [Standard] or a [Mode of Operation].
