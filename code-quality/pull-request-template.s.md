# [Standard] Pull Request Template

## Owner: [Xavier Lef√®vre](https://github.com/xavierlefevre)

## Description
- A Pull Request template is a markdown document shown every time a pull request is made by a developer. You can put any content in it, it usualy serves the developer and its reviewer as a reminder of what a good PR should be.

## Impact
- This tool is mostly used in order to give contexts to reviewers about what and how the developer developed its feature. It's also extremely useful to remind to the developer and the reviewer some key development standards they should not forget or overlook such as unit testing your app or testing your app against different types of machines/devices.

## Checks
- [ ] Include, adapt and version the [attached pull request template](/code-quality/pull_request_template.md) to the base of your project
