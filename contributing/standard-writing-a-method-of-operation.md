## Owner: Yann Leflour

## Checks:

* File name should be kebab case and suffixed by `.mo`
* Is referenced in the root _README.MD_ and _SUMMARY.MD_
* Should contain the following parts:
  * An owner with a link to their Github Profile
  * Title + time
  * A list of prerequisites
  * A list of steps
    * A _Name_ and aproximate _time to complete_
    * A _how to_
    * A way to _check_ that the step has been completed appropriately
  * Troubleshooting _\(optional\)_
* Title should be prefixed by _\[MO\]_

## Bad Examples

### Example 1: [\[MO\] Debug Javascript on an iOS Device](../react-native/debugging/mo-debug-javascript-on-an-ios-device.md)

* There is no owner
* No time is mentioned
* No checks are mentioned
* Troubleshooting is not in its own part

## Good Examples

### Example 2: [Kick start a JS GraphQL 3 layers API with Apollo-server, Dataloader and Knex \(~75min\)](../backend/graphql-js/mo-kick-start-a-js-graphql-3-layers-api-with-apollo-server-dataloader-and-knex.md)
