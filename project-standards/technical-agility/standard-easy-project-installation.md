# \[Standard\] Easy project installation

## Owner: _TBD_

## Description

* In order to make sure that a new BAMer or even an external team could easily without too much waste install the project and start creating value under 15 minutes.

## Impact

* If the team does not regularly kill and re-install the project, in order to update the install process documentation, there is a high risk that a new developer arriving on the project spends several hours to try to launch the project on its machine.
