# [Standard] Stable and up-to-date dependencies

## Owner: [Xavier Lef√®vre](https://github.com/xavierlefevre)

## Description
- The project code dependencies such as NPM packages need to be very regularly updated, the team should check once per sprint.

## Impact
- An old dependency, can become deprecated and not adapt well with new operating systems, browers, development tools, etc.

## Checks
*TBD*

## Bad Examples

### redacted project
- Problem: Cordova has not been updated for several months on the project and one day a developer could not launch the app on an iOS emulator because his new Xcode version had an emulator list descreprency not handled by this old Cordova version, but handled by the new one.
- Loss: 1h30 of debugging + 1h30 of problem solving

## Good Examples
*TBD*

## Upgrading React Native

React Native is very probably the dependency you'll have to upgrade the more often so we felt it was worth dedicating a whole section to it.

### How to

First of all, if you are late by several versions do them one at a time.
Skipping one might be really tough and you can get stuff done more often if you do it one version at a time.

To upgrade a version follow [the official documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/upgrading.html) on how to use `react-native-git-upgrade`.
Once you've upgraded React Native don't forget to update your dependencies - for example some might fail with the newest versions of React or others like CodePush are only working with specific versions of React Native.

If this is taking too long you can create a new React Native project from scratch and import all your javascript and native parts (CocoaPods, linking, etc.).

### Examples

#### 0.47 to 0.48

- Cinema project - using `react-native-git-upgrade`
  - Version upgrade: dea17b1add06f3984319792a7f667af162eda9f2 - AlexandreM
  - Unit tests fix: 889c07ff747925da7917a35b97bebcc0a86d2467 - LouisZ
  - Flow fix: ab53a4698300159cea5962e4d1e36b85ce67ed91 - NicolasD
