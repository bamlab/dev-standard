# [MO] Label tracking with Scrumble (~Xmin)

## Owner: Amaury Liet

## Intro

Scrumble offers you tools to have and share visibility about:
- the load of work left for a given track/label,
- the load of work already spent for a given track/label,

## Prerequisites (~1min)
- Go to scrumble and connect with Trello
- Open the `Labels Tracking` tab


## Steps

### 1. Select the Trello columns you want to consider (~1min)

For example the `Done` columns of all the completed sprints

### 2. Simply read the (approximate) complexity of each label


## Exemple

If we consider a project with this trello:

![Label tracking trello](/assets/label-tracking-trello.png)


The team can see, for each track:

- how much complexity has been done (by selecting the `DONE` columns):

- the load of work remaining (by selecting the `Backlog` columns):
