## Why

Having a set of common tools/libraries allow us to quickly move from one project to another, be more efficient and get a deep knowledege of each tool, including the advantages **and** drawbacks of these tools.

## I need a navigation solution to start my app

| Library/tool | What | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `react-navigation` | Navigation library for React Native | Recommended solution on [React Native documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigation.html), very customizable and with performant good enough for +90% of apps |
| `react-native-navigation` | Navigation implemented using native navigation components | If you need to use the native navigation components so that your navigation is 100% equivalent to a native app. |

## I need to display icons

| Library/tool | What | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `react-native-vector-icons` | Customizable Icons for React Native | Most comprehensive library of icons |

## I want to store the state of the app

| Library/tool | What | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `redux` | State container | Widely used in the React community, lots of dev tooling |
| `redux-persist` | Persistence of the data of the app | Simple to integrate with Redux and flexible |
| `redux-saga` | Handling of asynchronous processes in the app | Simple to integrate with Redux, testable, make complex business flow easy to read |

## I want to handle forms

| Library/tool | What | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `formik` | Forms handling library |  |
| `date-fns`, `moment` | Date handling library | Widely used libraries. |

## I want to handle animations

| Library/tool | What | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lottie \(`react-native-lottie`\) | Animation library | Good looking, performant animations. Easy to integrate in React Native. |

## I need to add testing to my app

| Library/tool | What | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| jest | Testing framework | Already integrated with React Native by default, allow to do snapshot testing |
| redux-saga-test-plan | Testing utilities for `redux-saga` | Allow to test redux-saga |
| Detox | End to end testing | Alternatives \(Calabash\) are not reliable enough and slow |

## I want static type checking

| Library/tool | What | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flowtype | Static typing | Improve developer experience, help to avoid errors when dealing with complex objects |
| Typescript | Static typing | More stable and mature than Flowtype. Never used on a React Native project at BAM yet |

## I want to ensure the quality of my codebase

| Library/tool | What | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prettier | Automatic formattting of source code | Avoid all discussions/loss of time on styling Integration/plugin for editors |
| eslint with `eslint-config-universe` | Linter |  |

## I want to be able to push on-the-fly updates to my app

| Library/tool | What | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AppCenter Code Push | Deploy mobile app updates without a full release | Speed up the deployment during development, allow for bug fixes and new features releases on the fly |

## I need to have crash/bugs reporting

| Library/tool | What | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sentry | Native crashes and JS exceptions reports | Easy integration and good React Native support with `react-native-sentry` |

## I need to add analytics/tracking to my app

| Library/tool | What | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Firebase Analytics | Analytics for mobile applications | The recommended solution by Google for applications, with a good quality native module for React Native \([react-native-firebase](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase)\) |

## I need to have automated deployment

| Library/tool | What | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fastlane | Automation of deployment tasks | Most widely used deployment tool for iOS/Android + existing actions for HockeyApp/App Center/App Store/Play Store |
| match | Automation of certificate/provisioning profile generation | Avoid dealing with certificates, one place storage for all certificates |

## I need a continuous integration service for launching tests

| Library/tool | What | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bitrise | Automation of applications builds | Ensure reproducible builds, avoid spending time building apps on developer computers |
| Travis CI | Automation of unit tests |  |
