# \[MO\] Preloading MobX data with AsyncStorage

## Control Points

{% hint style="success" %}
If you want to use another storage backend than asyncStorage, you'll still need to check that
{% endhint %}

* [ ] You persist data at least before the application is closed
* [ ] You hydrate your application with the persisted data before you display the content
* [ ] You burst the cache when needed \(on logout for personnal information for instance\)

## Motivation

* You want some data to be persisted accross application restart.

## Prerequisites

We need to import `AsyncStorage` from `react-native`.

The following example will use three simple methods:

* AsyncStorage.setItem\(key, value\)
* AsyncStorage.getItem\(key\)
* AsyncStorage.removeItem\(key\)

`key` and `value` are two strings, so don't pass a Javascript object in these functions! All AsyncStorage methods return a Promise object.

## Steps \(~15 minutes\)

It is recommended to use an extra layer of abstraction on top of the bare AsyncStorage that takes into account the particularities of the data you want to store. Let's start with a simple example where the hotel bookings I want to store have this structure:

```text
  booking
  |- id
  |- bookingDate
  |- clientId
  |- roomId
  |_ isPaymentConfirmed
```

`roomId` and `clientId` refer to the following objects:

```text
  client
  |- id
  |_ name
```

```text
  room
  |- id
  |- number
  |_ isAvailable
```

You have two options from this point:

1. Storing simple values

In this example, we want to display basic info about a current booking, such as `bookingDate`, `clientName`, and `roomNumber`. Let's first define a extra layer to list our AsyncStorage keys, in a `myAsyncStorage.js` file for example:

```jsx
import { AsyncStorage } from "react-native";

const BOOKING_DATE = "BOOKING_DATE";
const CLIENT_NAME = "CLIENT_NAME";
const ROOM_NUMBER = "ROOM_NUMBER";

export const asyncStorageKeys = {
  BOOKING_DATE,
  CLIENT_NAME,
  ROOM_NUMBER
};
```

These keys can be used to save/fetch data on the device in a `bookings.js` MobX store:

```jsx
import { observable, action } from 'mobx'
import { AsyncStorage } from 'react-native'
import { asyncStorageKeys } from 'myApp/src/services/myAsyncStorage'

class BookingsStore {
  constructor () {
    AsyncStorage.getItem(asyncStorageKeys.BOOKING_DATE)
      .then(bookingDate => {
        if (bookinDate) {
          this.bookingDate = bookingDate
        }
      })

      AsyncStorage.getItem(asyncStorageKeys.CLIENT_NAME)
      .then(clientName => {
        if (clientName) {
          this.clientName = clientName
        }
      })

      AsyncStorage.getItem(asyncStorageKeys.ROOM_NUMBER)
      .then(roomNumber => {
        if (roomNumber) {
          this.roomNumber = roomNumber
        }
      })
  }
  @observable bookingDate = null
  @observable clientName = ''
  @observable roomNumber = null

  @action setRoomNumber(roomNumber) {
    this.rootNumber = roomNumber
    AsyncStorage.setItem(asyncStorageKeys.ROOM_NUMBER, roomNumber)
  }

  @action clearRoomNumber(roomNumber) {
    this.rootNumber = null
    AsyncStorage.removeItem(asyncStorageKeys.ROOM_NUMBER, roomNumber)
  }
  }
}
```

This approach works fine until you want to preload data in the form of objects and not strings. e.g. multiple bookings. Fortunately there is a workaround to solve this issue.

1. Storing complex objects in JSON strings

We mentioned earlier that you shouldn't pass anything else than a string to `AsyncStorage.setItem`. You can however use `JSON.stringify` to convert your JavaScript objects to serialized JSON strings for storage. The original objects can be recovered using the `JSON.parse` method. Our `myAsyncStorage.js` file becomes:

```jsx
import { AsyncStorage } from 'react-native'

const BOOKINGS = 'BOOKINGS'
const CLIENT = 'CLIENT'
const ROOMS = 'ROOMS'

export const asyncStorageKeys = {
  BOOKINGS,
  CLIENT,
  ROOMS
}

export const getObjectFromAsyncStorage = (itemName) => {
  return AsyncStorage.getItem(itemName)
  .then(item => {
    if(item) JSON.parse(item)
    else {
      reject(Error('Empty result'))
    }
  ).catch(error => console.log(error))
}

export const setObjectInAsyncStorage = (key, value) => {
  const valueString = JSON.stringify(value)
  AsyncStorage.setItem(key, value)
}
```

Notice how the file has become more manageable and easy to read. To manage the conversion between Javascript objects and the strings that AsyncStorage receives, it is recommended to define a couple of getter/setter helper functions. You will avoid systematically calling `JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify` outside `myAsyncStorage.js`, keeping your code even more readable:

```jsx
import { observable, action } from 'mobx'
import { AsyncStorage } from 'react-native'
import { asyncStorageKeys, getObjectFromAsyncStorage, setItemInAsyncStorage } from 'myApp/src/services/myAsyncStorage'

class BookingsStore {
  constructor () {
    getObjectFromAsyncStorage(asyncStorageKeys.BOOKINGS)
    .then(bookings.map(booking =>
      this.bookings.push = booking)
    }))

    getObjectFromAsyncStorage(asyncStorageKeys.CLIENT)
    .then(client => {
      this.client = client
    })

    getObjectFromAsyncStorage(asyncStorageKeys.ROOMS)
    .then(rooms.map(room => {
      this.rooms.push(room)
    }))
  }
  @observable bookings = []
  @observable client = null
  @observable rooms = []

  @action leaveRoom(roomId) {
    this.rooms = this.rooms.map(room => {
      if (room.id === roomId) {
        room.isAvailable = true
      }
      return room
    })
    setItemInAsyncStorage(asyncStorageKeys.ROOMS, this.rooms)
  }

  @action clearRooms(roomNumber) {
    this.rooms = []
    AsyncStorage.removeItem(asyncStorageKeys.ROOMS)
  }
  }
}
```

Notice that by using Promise rejection in the `getObjectFromAsyncStorage` method, we can avoid checking whether loaded items are empty, thus refactoring our code.
