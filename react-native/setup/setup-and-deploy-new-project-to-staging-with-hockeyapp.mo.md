# [MO] Setup & Deploy New Project to Staging with HockeyApp

{% hint style='warning' } **DEPRECATION**

This standard has been deprecated by [@felixmeziere](https://github.com/felixmeziere) on January 28 in favour of [[MO] Deploy to staging](./setup-and-deploy-new-project-to-staging.mo.md).

**Reason**: HockeyApp is meant to be deprecated by AppCenter. AppCenter is the new HockeyApp and there is [no loss of functionality](http://blog.m33.network/2017/09/react-native-devops-2-0-overview-of-mobile-center-next-generation-of-hockeyapp/).
